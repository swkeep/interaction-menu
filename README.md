A standalone DUI-based interaction menu for FiveM, designed to enhance player interactions with the environment on your server.

This menu isn't designed to replace target scripts (though you could, but it would take quite a bit of effort on your end). Instead, it's meant to work alongside them, adding an extra layer of interactions to players. That said, keep in mind that the script uses sprites and DUI, which can be more resource-intensive compared to NUI-based scripts (nothing to worry about if you have some experience with scripting).

## Developer Tools and Examples

The script includes numerous examples in the `/lua/examples` directory to help you get started.

To explore these examples live within your server:
1. Set `Config.devMode` and `Config.debugPoly` to `true` in `config.shared.lua`.
2. This enables developer mode, allowing you to see and interact with the examples in real time.

**Important:** Remember to disable developer mode when you're done testing for optimal performance.
