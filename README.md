## Documentation

Documentation is still a work in progress.  
In the meantime, check out the examples in [`/lua/examples`](./lua/examples) for guidance.

## Developer Tools and Examples

The script includes numerous examples in the `/lua/examples` directory to help you get started.

To explore these examples live within your server:
1. Set `Config.devMode` and `Config.debugPoly` to `true` in `config.shared.lua`.
2. This enables developer mode, allowing you to see and interact with the examples in real time.

**Important:** Remember to disable developer mode when you're done testing for optimal performance.
